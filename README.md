twitter-app
===========

We would like to see an app that uses the Twitter streaming API to grab the most popular recent tweets about the Champions League.

- Grab the relevant tweets from the streaming API and track retweets over time, without using a prebuilt Twitter-streaming library (since that would kind of defeat the purpose of this challenge).
- Continuously display the 10 most popular (retweeted) tweets from the past 10 minutes. You can decide the output format (console, web, etc.).
- Tests are a big plus, of course.

The purpose is to process a large stream of data in an efficient way. Please include comments and/or a short write-up that explains your design decisions. Put the code somewhere public (like GitHub or Bitbucket).
